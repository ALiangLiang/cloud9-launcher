## Ô∏è‚òÅÔ∏èCloud9 LauncherüöÄ (In dev)

It's a Nodejs application allows you manage your Cloud9 IDE workflows on your own server without the need of a terminal.

**UPDATE (2017/5/23):**
**For now, I'm still researching [c9 core](https://github.com/c9/core) and find a method to generate multiple workspace in one port.** I guess the key is about "plugins". Create a vfs-server and use various settings to "ide.html" which contain difference workspace path.

Read this in other languages: [English](README.md), [Ê≠£È´î‰∏≠Êñá](README.zh-tw.md)
